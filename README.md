# A/B Machines

An immersive theater project that explores people chasing American dream and their self-identity, inspired by Andy Warhol and his philosophy.

## Getting Started

### Install Command Line Tools in macOS without Xcode

openFramewroks has troubles with being compiled by [Xcode 10](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/xcode-10-0-build-errors/30447/6) and getting access to camera in macOS 10.4 Mojave. The simplest solution is Removing Xcode and only using Command Line Tools to compile and run projects.

Launch the Terminal and type the following command string

```
xcode-select --install
```

### Install Addons
