## Getting Started

### Install Command Line Tools in macOS without Xcode

Openframewroks has troubles with being compiled by [Xcode 10](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/xcode-10-0-build-errors/30447/6) and getting access to camera in macOS 10.4 Mojave. The simplest solution is only install Command Line Tools and compile projects using built-in terminal.
